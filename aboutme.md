My name is Sewon Lee. My research interests are:

- Environmental monitoring, especially indoor air quality
- Biomonitoring on emerging chemicals
- Environmental Epidemiology

My career highlights include international academic experiences and complex research initiatives managing interdisciplinary teams and project management. With proven expertise in large data cleaning, statistics, and exposure risk assessments, I have consistently contributed internationally to advancing public health and occupational safety, especially chemical risk assessment. 

### Education
