My name is Sewon Lee. My research interests are:

- Environmental monitoring, especially indoor air quality
- Biomonitoring on emerging chemicals
- Environmental Epidemiology



### Education

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
